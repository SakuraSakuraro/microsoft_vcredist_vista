# Microsoft Visual C++ All-In-One Runtimes
Well, basically, it's same as [Microsoft Visual C++ All-In-One Runtimes by TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/), but with the optional to separately installation Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 and 2017 Redistributable, and Windows Vista support

# How to install?

1. **Install ssl certificates update**

Go to certupd directory and typing the command:
   ```bash
   updroots.exe roots.sst
   ```
**Note:** Updating the certificates is not necessary, but then you won't be able to install anything higher than Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable

2. **Run install.bat as administrator privileges**
